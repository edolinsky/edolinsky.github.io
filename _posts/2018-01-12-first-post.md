Now that I'm wrapping up my degree and (presumably) will have a little time on my hands, I figure it'll be fun to keep
a blog where I can post about things I find interesting. I expect I'll write a little about technology (especially when
picking up new technologies), food posts (I like to cook), and the occasional vacation. Maybe I'll even do a bit of
a review on school. I'm not expecting anyone to read this, nor do I think I'll post very often (not that I won't want
to).

But, let's see how this goes...
