# About Me

I'm a scrappy, creative character with an insatiable craving to master new
technologies and tackle intimidating challenges.
I have proven experience designing and implementing software systems, and
owning them end-to-end in true DevOps fashion.
I'm a builder of things, lover of good beer and great company.

I live in Surrey, BC with my partner Kait and our cat Duchess.

I make *a lot* of bad jokes.
